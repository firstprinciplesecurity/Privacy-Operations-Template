### ‚òÄÔ∏è Introduction
Privacy and data security are interconnected components of a comprehensive approach to safeguarding personal information. The following diagram shows the intersection of privacy and security risks and is the basis for the proposed controls in this template.


## 1. Identity and Access control

Identity and access controls help strike a balance between providing necessary access for legitimate purposes and protecting individual privacy rights. 

| Domain | Identity Control | Access Control |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| User Authentication  | Verify the identity of individuals accessing the data or the systems. Strengthen identity verification by requiring multi-factor authentication (multiple forms of authentication, e.g., password, token) | Establish a foundation for controlling who can access specific data resources based on authenticated identity. |
| Authorization | Associate specific permissions with authenticated identities. Associate roles with individuals based on job function (RBAC)| Ensure that individuals have the appropriate level of access based on their roles, responsibilities, or specific permissions. Employ the Least Privilege principle.|
|Access Auditing| Track and log activities associated with specific identities.| Provide the information to internal teams and customer teams for investigation when needed.|
| User provisioning and de-provisioning | Manage the lifecycle of user accounts, ensuring timely creation and deactivation.| Revoke access when individuals no longer require it to minimize potential privacy violations.|

## 2. Data Lifecycle Management 

By implementing controls throughout the data lifecycle, organizations can enhance data privacy, comply with regulations, and minimize the risk of unauthorized access. 

| Data Lifecycle Management attribute | Control | 
| :--------: | :---: |
| Data Classification and Labeling  | Implement a robust data classification scheme to categorize data based on sensitivity levels. Automated tools are applied to label data according to the above classification scheme and for content discovery. Use metadata tagging to label data with sensitivity, sector, and regulatory attributes. Train employees and third parties on the classification scheme to ensure correct handling |
| Data Usage | Monitor and audit data usage to detect and investigate any unusual or unauthorized activities. Employ encryption, tokenization, data masking, and other forms of obfuscation to protect sensitive data in use, in transit, and at rest against unauthorized access or unintended exposure (see below under data protection controls)| 
|Data Retention| Establish a clear data retention policy outlining the duration for which different data types should be retained. Implement automated data retention solutions to enforce policy compliance. Regularly review and update data retention policies to align with changing business and regulatory requirements. Archive historical data separately from active data, applying appropriate security measures to the archived data.| 
| Data Disposal | Develop and implement a secure data disposal process that includes physical and digital destruction methods. Use data wiping tools to ensure complete data removal (versus soft removal) from applications, systems,, and storage devices. Maintain an inventory of decommissioned services, systems, and storage devices to ensure proper disposal or recycling. Establish procedures for secure disposal of paper documents containing sensitive information.|

## 3. Risk Assessments  

Privacy risk assessments involve identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential risks to the privacy of individuals' personal information.  The assessments could be combined with your regular security risk assessments or can be standalone. 

| Risk area | Controls / Risk mitigation strategy | 
| :--------: | :---: |
| Data Mapping  | Create an inventory of the types of personal information processed, stored, and transmitted by the organization. Identify the flow of personal data across systems, departments, and external entities.|
| Data Privacy Impact Assessments | Conduct DPIAs for new projects or changes in data processing activities to identify and mitigate privacy risks.Integrate privacy considerations into the development lifecycle of systems and applications. Document and communicate the outcomes of DPIAs to relevant stakeholders. Privacy considerations should also focus on the following: *Data Subject Rights*: Evaluate the organization's ability to fulfill data subject rights Requests, such as access, rectification, and deletion. Verify mechanisms for handling and responding to data subject requests. *Consent Management*: Evaluate the processes for obtaining and managing consent for collecting and processing personal data. Verify that consent mechanisms are transparent, specific, and aligned with regulatory requirements.| 
| Third-Party Risk Management| Assess the privacy practices of third-party vendors and service providers. Ensure that contractual agreements include privacy and security requirements for third parties handling personal information.| 

## 4. Data Protection Standards 
Data protection standards include policies related to protecting and obscuring data in addition to the roles and access.

|Data Attribute | Control | 
| :--------: | :---: |
| Data encryption   | Establish policies, procedures, scenarios, and processes to identify Confidential Information or PII that must be encrypted to protect against persons or programs that have not been granted access.|
| Data masking | Establish policies and procedures that govern the masked data. This includes determining who is authorized to access this data, under which circumstances, and which purposes this data serves (e.g., testing, reporting, research, etc.)| 
|Data Loss Protection| Classify data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact on the organization should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. Classification of data will aid in determining baseline security controls for the protection of the data| 
| Security and Privacy-focused User Awareness | Create a culture of security and privacy through a combination and coordinated approach of policies, employee awareness, and technologies that help inform users. Regular updates and adaptability to emerging threats and regulations are essential for an effective security and privacy awareness program.|

## 5. Privacy / Trust Response
Establishing and implementing a clear trust response plan outlining organizational policies and procedures for addressing a potential incident is essential in protecting the privacy of employee and customer end-user data.

| Response Stage | Plan of Action | 
| :--------: | :---: |
| Privacy Incident response   | Implement monitoring tools and processes to detect privacy incidents in real-time. Establish thresholds and triggers for alerting on suspicious activities. Designate a response team responsible for promptly triaging privacy incidents. Classify incidents based on severity and potential impact on individuals' privacy. Conduct thorough forensic investigations to determine privacy incidents' scope and root cause. Preserve evidence in a forensically sound manner to support potential legal proceedings|
| Notification | Ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws and regulations regarding breach notifications.  Establish clear communication protocols for notifying affected individuals, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. Maintain detailed records of all privacy incidents, including messages sent and responses received.|
